# YoutubeDataAnalysis
YouTube today is one of the largest video streaming platforms in the world and yet the way its algorithm handles the content is still quite unclear. We all have had these questions while YouTubing on why certain videos are on the trending list while others are not. This question is especially important for YouTube content creators. YouTube Creators are individuals who produce content for the platform. This is a unique model that empowers Creators to earn money through placed advertising, merchandise sales, and subscriptions.

In this project, we try to understand how YouTube ranks its trending videos. We also aim to provide insights for Content Creators on the kind of content to provide in order to increase their probability of making their video trend and in turn generate more revenue.

We try to address the above conundrum by analyzing the following questions :

Impact of likes, views, comment Count, and Video Duration.

When to publish a video to increase the probability of making it trend.

Understand the impact of tags, and how this could be used to increase the visibility of the video.

Video Titles: To find if there are certain words in the title which increase the clicks on videos.

We try to understand the impact of geography, culture, globalization, and economy on trending videos.

Watch out! We could be giving you the secret sauce to make your next video go viral.
